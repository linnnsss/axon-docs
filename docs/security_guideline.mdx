To ensure the stability and security of your Axon chain, please adhere to the following security assumptions:
* **Validator Trustworthiness**: Assume the absence of **any malicious** entities within the validator list. A secure Axon chain relies on trustworthy validators.
* **High Availability**: To maintain a robust network, it's crucial that at least `(n/3 + 1)` nodes remain online at all times. This level of availability helps safeguard the chain's continuous operation and resilience against potential disruptions.
